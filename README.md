Exercise 1: Latex Template

Using Latex create a template to submit reports, including:

<ol>

 <li>Heading with your name and the date</li>

 <li>Footer with exercise number and course name and year</li>

 <li>A title</li>

 <li>An abstract</li>

 <li>Di erent sections, such as (if applicable)

  <ul>

   <li>Theory: Explain brie y the theory you have based your solution on.</li>

   <li>Code development: Introduce strategies, tests, and report debugging problems, compilations options.</li>

   <li>Results: Present data and explain your results.</li>

   <li>Self-evalutation: What have you learned? What can be done next? What went wrong and why?</li>

<ul>

 <li>Prepare this and following weekly reports using such template. The maximum length of the report is ve pages.</li>

 <li>Upload the report in Moodle under the correspondent exercise.</li>

 <li>File names must include your name, exercise number and codewords report, and code. Example: Ex2-Rossi-REPORT.pdf</li>

</ul>

Exercise 2: Derived Types

In Fortran90 write a MODULE which contains a double complex matrix derived TYPE that includes the components: Matrix elements, Matrix Dimensions, Matrix Trace, and Matrix Determinant.

<ul>

 <li>De ne the correspondent TYPE.</li>

 <li>De ne a function/subroutine that initializes this new TYPE</li>

 <li>De ne the functions/subroutines Trace and Adjoint</li>

 <li>De ne the correspondent Interfaces of the previous points.</li>

 <li>De ne a subroutine that writes on le the Matrix TYPE in a readable form.</li>

 <li>Include everything in a test program.</li>

</ul>
